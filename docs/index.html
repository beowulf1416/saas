        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Software-as-a-service is an ERP/CRM/MFG/SCM application implemented using 
            Java Spring Framework and SQL in the backend and HTML and javascript on the
            frontend.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is little to no dynamic sql involved. All data access is thru stored procedures.
        </p>

            Inspiration is taken from Adempiere (https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere)
            with some of the ideas taken from real life usage.
